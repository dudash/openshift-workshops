A workshop is a class or series of classes in which a small group of people learn the methods and skills used in doing something.

This class is for people learning OpenShift, Red Hat's Platform as a Service (PaaS).

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the project on GitHub and provide your comments/feedback.

Thanks!
