## That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the OpenShift environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how containers and container orchestration works.  Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires" in the demo environment we've setup and explore both the web console and the oc command line client.

## Get even deeper
While you're here, we can help you install the [Container Development Kit (CDK)][3] on your laptop.  It requires a couple large downloads, but the install process is reallly easy.  You can find the [install and getting started guides here][4].

Here are some good resources to continue learning OpenShift:
* [Open Shift Architecture][1]
* [Open Shift Developer's Guide][2]
