# Objectives
After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Understand how to use Templates to deploy application(s).

# Using Templates

Running all these individual commands can be tedious and error prone. Fortunately for you, all of this configuration can be put together into a single Template which can then be processed to create a full set of resources. A Template may define parameters for certain values, such as DB username or password, and they can be automatically generated by OpenShift at processing time.

Administrators can load Templates into OpenShift and make them available to all users, even via the web console. Users can create Templates and load them into their own Projects for other users (with access) to share and use.

The great thing about Templates is that they can speed up the deployment workflow for application development by providing a "recipe" of sorts that can be deployed with a single command. Not only that, they can be loaded into OpenShift from an external URL, which will allow you to keep your templates in a version control system.

Let's combine all of the exercises we have performed in the last three labs into a single Template that we can then instantiate with a single command. I bet you are probably hating us now for having you go through all of that work when you could have issued a single command! Just remember that it is important for you to understand how to create, deploy, and wire resources together.

In order for the magic to happen, first create a new project and add the template to the project:

    $ oc new-project mlbparks-template

![OC New Project MLB Parks Template]({{ site.url }}/images/2016/02/oc-new-project-mlbparks-template.png)

    $ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gshipley/openshift3mlbparks/master/mlbparks-template.json

![OC Create MLB Parks Template]({{ site.url }}/images/2016/02/oc-create-mlbparks-template.png)

Now we have access to the application template in our project. As a side note, administrators have the capability to add templates to the general openshift project which will in turn provide an application template to any user on the system.

:fireworks: Are you ready for the magic command? Here it is:

    $ oc new-app mlbparks

![OC New Application MLB Parks Template]({{ site.url }}/images/2016/02/oc-new-app-mlbparks-template.png )

OpenShift will automatically start a build for you. When it is complete, visit your app. Does it work? Think about how this could be used in your environment. For example, a template could define a large set of resources that make up a "reference application", complete with several app servers, databases, and more. You could deploy the entire set of resources with one command, and then hack on them to develop new features, microservices, fix bugs, and more.

As a final exercise, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gshipley/openshift3mlbparks/master/mlbparks-template.json) to look at the template that was used to create the resources for our mlbparks application.
